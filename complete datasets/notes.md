This folders contains 2 annotated datasets of marine vessels captured University of Victoria's Coastal and Ocean Resource Analysis Laboratory [CORAL](www.coral.geog.uvic.ca) using a static camera focused off-shore to the south and west of southern Vancouver Island, BC, Canada, during the years of 2019 and 2020. 

A LOREX\textregistered pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) camera was installed at two fixed positions on a headland overlooking a major vessel traffic thoroughfare and configured to continuously capture three $1920 \times 1080$ pixels photos in the first 15 seconds of each minute. 

We manually annotate two datasets used to evaluate the proposed hybrid detector under two conditions: 
* **D1**: 633 images containing boats of various sizes (mean vessel area of 953 pixels)
* **D2**: 138 images presenting only small boats with a mean area of 79 pixels. D2 highlights the capabilities of the DSMV, as most of its marine vessels are missed by the state-of-the-art object detectors. 

While creating both D1 and D2 we selected images under different weather conditions and vessel layouts, so that all monitoring scenarios are well represented.
